# Key Management Utility \(KMU\)<a name="key_mgmt_util"></a>

The key management utility \(KMU\) is a command line tool that helps crypto users \(CU\) manage keys on the hardware security modules \(HSM\)\. KMU includes multiple commands that generate, delete, import, and export keys, get and set attributes, find keys, and perform cryptographic operations\. 

KMU and CMU are part of [the Client SDK 3 suite](choose-client-sdk.md)\.

For a quick start, see [Getting started with key\_mgmt\_util](key_mgmt_util-getting-started.md)\. For detailed information about the commands, see [key\_mgmt\_util command reference](key_mgmt_util-reference.md)\. For help interpreting the key attributes, see the [Key Attribute Reference](key-attribute-table.md)\. 

To use key\_mgmt\_util if you are using Linux, connect to your client instance and then see [Install and configure the AWS CloudHSM client \(Linux\)](kmu-install-and-configure-client-linux.md)\. If you are using Windows, see [Install and configure the AWS CloudHSM client \(Windows\)](kmu-install-and-configure-client-win.md)\.
