# Deleting an AWS CloudHSM cluster<a name="delete-cluster"></a>

Before you can delete a cluster, you must remove all HSMs from the cluster\. For more information, see [Removing an HSM](add-remove-hsm.md#remove-hsm)\.

After you remove all HSMs, you can delete a cluster by using the [AWS CloudHSM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/), the [AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\)](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/), or the AWS CloudHSM API\.

**To delete a cluster \(console\)**

1. Open the AWS CloudHSM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudhsm/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/home)\.

1. Choose the cluster that you are deleting\. Then choose **Delete cluster**\.

1. Confirm that you want to delete the cluster, then choose **Delete**\.

**To delete a cluster \(AWS CLI\)**
+ At a command prompt, issue the [delete\-cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudhsmv2/delete-cluster.html) command, passing the ID of the cluster that you are deleting\. If you don't know the cluster ID, issue the [describe\-clusters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudhsmv2/describe-clusters.html) command\.

  ```
  $ aws cloudhsmv2 delete-cluster --cluster-id <cluster ID>
  {
      "Cluster": {
          "Certificates": {
              "ClusterCertificate": "<certificate string>"
