# Client SDK 5 user contains inconsistent values<a name="troubleshoot-sdk5-inconsistent-value"></a>

The `user list` command returns a list of all users, and user properties, in your cluster\. If any of a userâ€™s properties have the value "**inconsistent**", this user is not synchronized across your cluster\. This means that the user exists with different properties on different HSMs in the cluster\. Based on which property is inconsistent, different repair steps can be taken\. 

 The following table includes steps to resolve inconsistencies for a single user\. If a single user has multiple inconsistencies, resolve them by following these steps from top to bottom\. If there are multiple users with inconsistencies, work through this list for each user, fully resolving the inconsistencies for that user before moving on the next\. 

**Note**  
To perform these steps you should ideally be logged in as an admin\. If your admin account is not consistent, go through these steps logging in with the admin and repeating the steps until all properties are consistent\. After your admin account is consistent, you can proceed to use that admin to synchronize other users in the cluster\.


| Inconsistent property | Example output of user list | Implication  | Recovery method  | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| User "role" is "inconsistent" | <pre>{<br />"username": <br />"test_user",    <br />"role": "inconsistent",    <br />"locked": "false",    <br />"mfa": [],     <br />"cluster-coverage": "full"<br />}</pre> | This user is a CryptoUser on some HSMs, and an Admin on other HSMs\. This can happen if two SDKs attempt to create the same user, at the same time, with different roles\.You must remove this user, and re\-create it with the desired role\. |  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/troubleshoot-sdk5-inconsistent-value.html)  | 
| User "cluster\-coverage" is "inconsistent" | <pre>{<br />"username": "test_user",    <br />"role": "crypto-user",    <br />"locked": "false",    <br />"mfa": [],     <br />"cluster-coverage": "inconsistent"<br />}</pre> |  This user exists on a subset of HSMs in the cluster\.This can happen if a user create partially succeeded, or if a user delete partially succeeded\. You must finish your previous operation, either creating or removing this user from your cluster\.  |  If the user should not exist, follow these steps: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/troubleshoot-sdk5-inconsistent-value.html) If the user should exist, follow these steps: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/troubleshoot-sdk5-inconsistent-value.html)  | 
| User "locked" parameter is "inconsistent" or "true" | <pre>{<br />"username": <br />"test_user",    <br />"role": "crypto-user",    <br />"locked": inconsistent,    <br />"mfa": [],     <br />"cluster-coverage": "full"<br />}</pre> |  This user is locked out on a subset of HSMs\. This can happen if a user uses the wrong password and only connects to a subset of HSMs in the cluster\. You must change the user's credentials to be consistent across the cluster\.  |  If the user has MFA activated, follow these steps: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/troubleshoot-sdk5-inconsistent-value.html) If MFA should be active for the user, follow these steps: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/troubleshoot-sdk5-inconsistent-value.html)  | 
| MFA status is "inconsistent" | <pre>{    <br />"username": "test_user",    <br />"role": "crypto-user",    <br />"locked": "false",    <br />"mfa": [<br />  {            <br />   "strategy": "token-sign",<br />   "status": "inconsistent"<br />   }    <br />],     <br />"cluster-coverage": "full"<br />}</pre> |  This user has different MFA flags on different HSMs in the cluster\. This can happen if an MFA operation only completed on a subset of HSMs\. You must reset the user's password, and allow them to re\-enable MFA\.  |  If the user has MFA activated, follow these steps: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/troubleshoot-sdk5-inconsistent-value.html) If MFA should be active for the user, follow these steps: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/troubleshoot-sdk5-inconsistent-value.html)  |
