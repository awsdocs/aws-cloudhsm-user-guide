------

Significant changes in this version include:

**AWS CloudHSM Client Software**
+ Improved stability and bug fixes\.
+ In cloud\_hsm\_mgmt\_util, enable\_e2e now set by default\.
+ **SECURITY FIX: **in key\_mgmt\_util, resolved issue with the incorrect PKCS\#1v1\.5 signature parsing\. This eliminates potential errors when validating signatures with imported RSA keys that use a public exponent of 3\. CloudHSM does not allow generating RSA keys with exponents smaller than 65537 to meet FIPS 140\-2 requirements\.

**PKCS \#11 Library**
+ Improved stability and bug fixes\.
+ **SECURITY FIX: **Resolved issue with incorrect PKCS\#1v1\.5 signature parsing\. This eliminates potential errors when validating signatures with imported RSA keys that use a public exponent of 3\. CloudHSM does not allow generating RSA keys with exponents smaller than 65537 to meet FIPS 140\-2 requirements\.
+ **BREAKING CHANGE: **To protect against user error, AES\-GCM initialization now requires the user supplied IV buffer to be zeroized\. NIST requires the IV for AES\-GCM to be generated by the HSM and noted by the application after encryption is complete, as described [here](pkcs11-mechanisms.md)\. IV is always 12 bytes long\.
+ Added support for CKM\_RSA\_PKCS\_KEY\_PAIR\_GEN mechanism\.
+ Added software hashing of buffers larger than 16KB for digest, sign and verify operations\. Hashes of buffers less than 16KB continue to be offloaded to the HSM as before\.
+ **BREAKING CHANGE:** Strengthened PKCS\#11 compliance, including explicit failure when handling unsupported or inconsistent attributes\. If your application was not strictly PKCS\#11 compliant before, you may experience errors or failures after updating to this version\. Specifically:
  + If an application is already logged in, logging in will now return the error CKR\_USER\_ALREADY\_LOGGED\_IN\.
  + CKA\_KEY\_GEN\_MECHANISM will cause an error if included in a C\_CreateObject call\.
  + CKA\_ALWAYS\_SENSITIVE, CKA\_LOCAL and CKA\_NEVER\_EXTRACTABLE will cause errors if included in a key generation or import template\.
  + CKA\_VALUE\_LEN is now validated\.
  + By default, new keys are scoped as session keys rather than token keys, to comply with PKCS\#11\.

**OpenSSL Dynamic Engine**
+ Improved stability and bug fixes\.
+ **SECURITY FIX:** Resolved issue with incorrect PKCS\#1v1\.5 signature parsing\. This eliminates potential errors when validating signatures with imported RSA keys that use a public exponent of 3\. CloudHSM does not allow generating RSA keys with exponents smaller than 65537 to meet FIPS 140\-2 requirements\.

**Java Library**
+ Improved stability and bug fixes\.
+ Added software hashing of buffers larger than 16KB for digest, sign and verify operations\. Hashes of buffers less than 16KB continue to be offloaded to the HSM as before\.
+ For non\-exportable keys, getFormat and getEncoded now return NULL without throwing an exception\.

**Windows \(CNG, KSP\)**
+ **SECURITY FIX: **Resolved issue with incorrect PKCS\#1v1\.5 signature parsing\. This eliminates potential errors when validating signatures with imported RSA keys that use a public exponent of 3\. CloudHSM does not allow generating RSA keys with exponents smaller than 65537 to meet FIPS 140\-2 requirements\.
