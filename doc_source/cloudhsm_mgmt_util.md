# CloudHSM Management Utility \(CMU\)<a name="cloudhsm_mgmt_util"></a>

The **cloudhsm\_mgmt\_util** command line tool helps crypto officers manage users in the HSMs\. It includes tools that create, delete, and list users, and change user passwords\. 

KMU and CMU are part of [the Client SDK 3 suite](choose-client-sdk.md)\.

cloudhsm\_mgmt\_util also includes commands that allow crypto users \(CUs\) to share keys and get and set key attributes\. These commands complement the key management commands in the primary key management tool, [key\_mgmt\_util](key_mgmt_util.md)\.
