# deleteUser<a name="cloudhsm_mgmt_util-deleteUser"></a>

The deleteUser command in cloudhsm\_mgmt\_util deletes a user from the hardware security modules \(HSM\)\. Only crypto officers \(CO\) can run this command\. You cannot delete a user who is currently logged into a HSM\. For more information about deleting users, see [How to Delete HSM Users](cli-users.md#delete-user)\.

**Tip**  
You can't delete crypto users \(CU\) that own keys\.

## User type<a name="deleteUser-userType"></a>

The following types of users can run this command\.
+ CO

## Syntax<a name="deleteUser-syntax"></a>

Because this command does not have named parameters, you must enter the arguments in the order specified in the syntax diagram\.

```
deleteUser <user-type> <user-name>
```

## Example<a name="deleteUser-examples"></a>

This example deletes a crypto officer \(CO\) from the HSMs in a cluster\. The first command uses [listUsers](cloudhsm_mgmt_util-listUsers.md) to list all users on the HSMs\.

The output shows that user `3`, `alice`, is a CO on the HSMs\.

```

The second command uses the deleteUser command to delete `alice` from the HSMs\. 

The output shows that the command succeeded on all three HSMs in the cluster\.

```
aws-cloudhsm> deleteUser CO alice
Deleting user alice(CO) on 3 nodes
deleteUser success on server 0(10.0.0.1)
deleteUser success on server 0(10.0.0.2)
deleteUser success on server 0(10.0.0.3)
```

The final command uses the listUsers command to verify that `alice` is deleted from all three of the HSMs on the cluster\.

```

```
deleteUser <user-type> <user-name>
```

**<user\-type>**  
Specifies the type of user\. This parameter is required\.   
You can't delete crypto users \(CU\) that own keys\.
Valid values are **CO**, **CU**\.  
To get the user type, use [listUsers](cloudhsm_mgmt_util-listUsers.md)\. For detailed information about the user types on an HSM, see [Understanding HSM users](manage-hsm-users-chsm-cli.md#understanding-users)\.  
Required: Yes

**<user\-name>**  
Specifies a friendly name for the user\. The maximum length is 31 characters\. The only special character permitted is an underscore \( \_ \)\.

Required: Yes
