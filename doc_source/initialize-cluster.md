# Initialize the Cluster<a name="initialize-cluster"></a>

Complete the steps in the following topics to initialize your AWS CloudHSM cluster\.

**Note**  
Before you initialize the cluster, review the process by which you can [verify the identity and authenticity of the HSMs](verify-hsm-identity.md)\. This process is optional and works only until a cluster is initialized\. After the cluster is initialized, you cannot use this process to get your certificates or verify the HSMs\. 

Also, you must change the permissions on the `my-key-pair.pem` file you created earlier, to more restrictive permissions (chmod 400 or chmod 600). Otherwise, accessing your instance will be accompanied by warnings that the `.pem` file is too accessible.

## Get the Cluster CSR<a name="get-csr"></a>

Before you can initialize the cluster, you must download and sign a certificate signing request \(CSR\) that is generated by the cluster's first HSM\. If you followed the steps to [verify the identity of your cluster's HSM](verify-hsm-identity.md), you already have the CSR and you can sign it\. Otherwise, get the CSR now by using the [AWS CloudHSM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/), the [AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\)](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/), or the AWS CloudHSM API\. 

**To get the CSR \(console\)**

1. Open the AWS CloudHSM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudhsm/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/)\.

1. Choose **Initialize** next to the cluster that you [created previously](create-cluster.md)\. 

1. When the CSR is ready, you see a link to download it\.  
![\[Download certificate signing request page in the AWS CloudHSM console.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/images/console-download-certificates.png)

   Choose **Cluster CSR** to download and save the CSR\.

**To get the CSR \([AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/)\)**
+ At a command prompt, run the following [describe\-clusters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudhsmv2/describe-clusters.html) command, which extracts the CSR and saves it to a file\. Replace *<cluster ID>* with the ID of the cluster that you [created previously](create-cluster.md)\. 

  ```
  $ aws cloudhsmv2 describe-clusters --filters clusterIds=<cluster ID> \
                                     --output text \
                                     --query 'Clusters[].Certificates.ClusterCsr' \
                                     > <cluster ID>_ClusterCsr.csr
  ```

**To get the CSR \(AWS CloudHSM API\)**

1. Send a [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeClusters.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeClusters.html) request\.

1. Extract and save the CSR from the response\.

## Sign the CSR<a name="sign-csr"></a>

Currently, you must create a self\-signed signing certificate and use it to sign the CSR for your cluster\. You do not need the AWS CLI for this step, and the shell does not need to be associated with your AWS account\. To sign the CSR, you must do the following:

1. Get the CSR \(see [Get the Cluster CSR](#get-csr)\)\.

1. Create a private key\.

1. Use the private key to create a signing certificate\.

1. Sign your cluster CSR\.

### Create a private key<a name="sign-csr-create-key"></a>

Use the following command to create a private key\. For a production cluster, the key should be created in a secure manner using a trusted source of randomness\. We recommend that you use a secured offsite and offline HSM or the equivalent\. Store the key safely\. If you can demonstrate that you own the key, you can also demonstrate that you own the cluster and the data it contains\. 

During development and test, you can use any convenient tool \(such as OpenSSL\) to create and sign the cluster certificate\. The following example shows you how to create a key\. After you have used the key to create a self\-signed certificate \(see below\), you should store it in a safe manner\. To sign into your AWS CloudHSM instance, the certificate must be present, but the private key does not\. You use the key only for specific purposes such as restoring from a backup\. 

When asked to `Enter passphrase for customerCA.key`, create a passphrase and enter it\.

```
$ openssl genrsa -aes256 -out customerCA.key 2048
Generating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus
........+++
............+++
e is 65537 (0x10001)
Enter pass phrase for customerCA.key:
Verifying - Enter pass phrase for customerCA.key:
```

### Use the private key to create a self\-signed certificate<a name="sign-csr-create-cert"></a>

The trusted hardware that you use to create the private key for your production cluster should also provide a software tool to generate a self\-signed certificate using that key\. The following example uses OpenSSL and the private key that you created in the previous step to create a signing certificate\. The certificate is valid for 10 years \(3652 days\)\. Read the on\-screen instructions and follow the prompts\. 

```
$ openssl req -new -x509 -days 3652 -key customerCA.key -out customerCA.crt
Enter pass phrase for customerCA.key:
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:
Locality Name (eg, city) []:
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:
Email Address []:
```

This command creates a certificate file named `customerCA.crt`\. Put this certificate on every host from which you will connect to your AWS CloudHSM cluster\. If you give the file a different name or store it in a path other than the root of your host, you should edit your client configuration file accordingly\. Use the certificate and the private key you just created to sign the cluster certificate signing request \(CSR\) in the next step\. 

### Sign the Cluster CSR<a name="sign-csr-sign-cluster-csr"></a>

The trusted hardware that you use to create your private key for your production cluster should also provide a tool to sign the CSR using that key\. The following example uses OpenSSL to sign the cluster's CSR\. The example uses your private key and the self\-signed certificate that you created in the previous step\. 

```
$ openssl x509 -req -days 3652 -in <cluster ID>_ClusterCsr.csr \
                              -CA customerCA.crt \
                              -CAkey customerCA.key \
                              -CAcreateserial \
                              -out <cluster ID>_CustomerHsmCertificate.crt
Signature ok
subject=/C=US/ST=CA/O=Cavium/OU=N3FIPS/L=SanJose/CN=HSM:<HSM identifer>:PARTN:<partition number>, for FIPS mode
Getting CA Private Key
Enter pass phrase for customerCA.key:
```

This command creates a file named `<cluster ID>_CustomerHsmCertificate.crt`\. Use this file as the signed certificate when you initialize the cluster\. 

## Initialize the Cluster<a name="initialize"></a>

Use your signed HSM certificate and your signing certificate to initialize your cluster\. You can use the [AWS CloudHSM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/), the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/), or the AWS CloudHSM API\. 

**To initialize a cluster \(console\)**

1. Open the AWS CloudHSM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudhsm/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/)\.

1. Choose **Initialize** next to the cluster that you created previously\.

1. On the **Download certificate signing request** page, choose **Next**\. If **Next** is not available, first choose one of the CSR or certificate links\. Then choose **Next**\.

1. On the **Sign certificate signing request \(CSR\)** page, choose **Next**\.

1. On the **Upload the certificates** page, do the following:

   1. Next to **Cluster certificate**, choose **Upload file**\. Then locate and select the HSM certificate that you signed previously\. If you completed the steps in the previous section, select the file named `<cluster ID>_CustomerHsmCertificate.crt`\.

   1. Next to **Issuing certificate**, choose **Upload file**\. Then select your signing certificate\. If you completed the steps in the previous section, select the file named `customerCA.crt`\. 

   1. Choose **Upload and initialize**\.

**To initialize a cluster \([AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/)\)**
+ At a command prompt, run the [initialize\-cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudhsmv2/initialize-cluster.html) command\. Provide the following: 
  + The ID of the cluster that you created previously\.
  + The HSM certificate that you signed previously\. If you completed the steps in the previous section, it's saved in a file named `<cluster ID>_CustomerHsmCertificate.crt`\. 
  + Your signing certificate\. If you completed the steps in the previous section, the signing certificate is saved in a file named `customerCA.crt`\.

  ```
  $ aws cloudhsmv2 initialize-cluster --cluster-id <cluster ID> \
                                      --signed-cert file://<cluster ID>_CustomerHsmCertificate.crt \
                                      --trust-anchor file://customerCA.crt
  {
      "State": "INITIALIZE_IN_PROGRESS",
      "StateMessage": "Cluster is initializing. State will change to INITIALIZED upon completion."
  }
  ```
