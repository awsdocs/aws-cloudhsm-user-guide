# \(Optional\) Step 5: Add a load balancer with Elastic Load Balancing<a name="ssl-offload-add-load-balancing-windows"></a>

After you set up SSL/TLS offload with one web server, you can create more web servers and an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer that routes HTTPS traffic to the web servers\. A load balancer can reduce the load on your individual web servers by balancing traffic across two or more servers\. It can also increase the availability of your website because the load balancer monitors the health of your web servers and only routes traffic to healthy servers\. If a web server fails, the load balancer automatically stops routing traffic to it\.

   1. In the **Instances** section, select the check boxes next to your web server instances\. Then choose **Add to registered**\. 

   1. Choose **Next: Review**\.

1. Review your load balancer details, then choose **Create**\.

1. When the load balancer has been successfully created, choose **Close**\.

After you complete the preceding steps, the Amazon EC2 console shows your Elastic Load Balancing load balancer\.

When your load balancer's state is active, you can verify that the load balancer is working\. That is, you can verify that it's sending HTTPS traffic to your web servers with SSL/TLS offload with AWS CloudHSM\. You can do this with a web browser or a tool such as [OpenSSL s\_client](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man1/s_client.html)\. 

**To verify that your load balancer is working with a web browser**

1. In the Amazon EC2 console, find the **DNS name** for the load balancer that you just created\. Then select the DNS name and copy it\. 

1. Use a web browser such as Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome to connect to your load balancer using the load balancer's DNS name\. Ensure that the URL in the address bar begins with https://\. 
**Tip**  
You can use a DNS service such as Amazon Route 53 to route your website's domain name \(for example, https://www\.example\.com/\) to your web server\. For more information, see [Routing Traffic to an Amazon EC2 Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-ec2-instance.html) in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* or in the documentation for your DNS service\.

1. Use your web browser to view the web server certificate\. For more information, see the following: 
   + For Mozilla Firefox, see [View a Certificate](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/secure-website-certificate#w_view-a-certificate) on the Mozilla Support website\.
   + For Google Chrome, see [Understand Security Issues](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/security) on the Google Tools for Web Developers website\.

   Other web browsers might have similar features that you can use to view the web server certificate\.

1. Ensure that the certificate is the one that you configured the web server to use\.

**To verify that your load balancer is working with OpenSSL s\_client**

1. Use the following OpenSSL command to connect to your load balancer using HTTPS\. Replace *<DNS name>* with the DNS name of your load balancer\. 

   ```
   openssl s_client -connect <DNS name>:443
   ```
**Tip**  
You can use a DNS service such as Amazon Route 53 to route your website's domain name \(for example, https://www\.example\.com/\) to your web server\. For more information, see [Routing Traffic to an Amazon EC2 Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-ec2-instance.html) in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* or in the documentation for your DNS service\.

1. Ensure that the certificate is the one that you configured the web server to use\.

You now have a website that is secured with HTTPS, with the web server's private key stored in an HSM in your AWS CloudHSM cluster\. Your website has two web servers and a load balancer to help improve efficiency and availability\.
