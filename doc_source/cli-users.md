# Using CloudHSM Management Utility \(CMU\) to manage users<a name="cli-users"></a>

This topic provides step\-by\-step instruction on managing hardware security module \(HSM\) users with CloudHSM Management Utility \(CMU\), a command line tool that comes with the Client SDK\. For more information about CMU or HSM users, see [CloudHSM Management Utility](cloudhsm_mgmt_util.md) and [Understanding HSM users](manage-hsm-users-chsm-cli.md#understanding-users)\.

## Understanding HSM user management with CMU<a name="understand-users"></a>

 To manage HSM users, you must log in to the HSM with the user name and password of a [cryptographic officer](manage-hsm-users-cmu.md#crypto-officer) \(CO\)\. Only COs can manage users\. The HSM contains a default CO named admin\. You set the password for admin when you [activated the cluster](activate-cluster.md)\. 

 To use CMU, you must use the configure tool to update the local configuration\. CMU creates its own connection to the cluster and this connection is *not* cluster aware\. To track cluster information, CMU maintains a local configuration file\. This means that *each time* you use CMU, you should first update the configuration file by running the [configure](configure-tool.md) command line tool with the `--cmu` parameter\. If you are using Client SDK 3\.2\.1 or earlier, you must use a different parameter than `--cmu`\. For more information, see [Using CMU with Client SDK 3\.2\.1 and earlier](#downlevel-cmu)\. 

 The `--cmu` parameter requires you to add the IP address of an HSM in your cluster\. If you have multiple HSMs, you can use any IP address\. This ensures CMU can propagate any changes you make across the entire cluster\. Remember that CMU uses its local file to track cluster information\. If the cluster has changed since the last time you used CMU from a particular host, you must add those changes to the local configuration file stored on that host\. Never add or remove a HSM while you're using CMU\. 

**To get an IP address for a HSM \(console\)**

1. Open the AWS CloudHSM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudhsm/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/home)\.

1. To change the AWS Region, use the Region selector in the upper\-right corner of the page\.

1. To open the cluster detail page, in the cluster table, choose the cluster ID\.

1. To get the IP address, on the HSMs tab, choose one of the IP addresses listed under **ENI IP address**\. 

**To get an IP address for a HSM \(AWS CLI\)**
+ Get the IP address of an HSM by using the [describe\-clusters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudhsmv2/describe-clusters.html) command from the AWS CLI\. In the output from the command, the IP address of the HSMs are the values of `EniIp`\. 

  ```
  $  aws cloudhsmv2 describe-clusters
  	
  
  {
      "Clusters": [
          { ... }
              "Hsms": [
                  {
  ...
                      "EniIp": "10.0.0.9",
  ...
                  },
                  {
  ...
                      "EniIp": "10.0.1.6",
  ...
  ```

### Using CMU with Client SDK 3\.2\.1 and earlier<a name="downlevel-cmu"></a>

With Client SDK 3\.3\.0, AWS CloudHSM added support for the `--cmu` parameter, which simplifies the process of updating the configuration file for CMU\. If you're using a version of CMU from Client SDK 3\.2\.1 or earlier, you must continue to use the `-a` and `-m` parameters to update the configuration file\. For more information about these parameters, see [Configure Tool](configure-tool.md)\.

## How to manage HSM users with CMU<a name="manage-users-cmu"></a>

This section includes basic commands to manage HSM users with CMU\. 

### To create HSM users<a name="create-users-cmu"></a>

Use createUser to create new users on the HSM\. You must log in as a CO to create a user\.

**To create a new CO user**

1. Use the configure tool to update the CMU configuration\.

------
#### [ Linux ]

   ```
   $ sudo /opt/cloudhsm/bin/configure --cmu <IP address>
   ```

------
#### [ Windows ]

   ```
   C:\Program Files\Amazon\CloudHSM\bin\ configure.exe --cmu <IP address>
   ```

------

1. Start CMU\.

------
#### [ Linux ]

   ```
   $ /opt/cloudhsm/bin/cloudhsm_mgmt_util /opt/cloudhsm/etc/cloudhsm_mgmt_util.cfg
   ```

------
#### [ Windows ]

   ```
   C:\Program Files\Amazon\CloudHSM> .\cloudhsm_mgmt_util.exe C:\ProgramData\Amazon\CloudHSM\data\cloudhsm_mgmt_util.cfg
   ```

------

1. Log in to the HSM as a CO user\.

   ```
   aws-cloudhsm>loginHSM CO admin co12345
   ```

   Make sure the number of connections CMU lists match the number of HSMs in the cluster\. If not, log out and start over\.

1. Use createUser to create a CO user named **example\_officer** with a password of **password1**\.

   ```
   aws-cloudhsm>createUser CO example_officer password1
   ```

   CMU prompts you about the create user operation\.

   ```

   ```
   aws-cloudhsm>createUser CU example_user password1
   ```

   CMU prompts you about the create user operation\.

   ```
