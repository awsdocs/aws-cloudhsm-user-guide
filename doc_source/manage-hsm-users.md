# Managing HSM users in AWS CloudHSM<a name="manage-hsm-users"></a>

 In AWS CloudHSM, you must use [CloudHSM CLI](cloudhsm_cli-getting-started.md) or [CloudHSM Management Utility \(CMU\)](cloudhsm_mgmt_util-getting-started.md) command line tools to create and manage the users on your HSM\. CloudHSM CLI is designed to be used with the latest SDK, while the CMU is designed to be used with previous SDKs\.
