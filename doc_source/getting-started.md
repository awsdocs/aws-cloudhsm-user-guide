# Getting Started with AWS CloudHSM<a name="getting-started"></a>

The following topics contain information to help you create, initialize, and activate an AWS CloudHSM cluster\. After you complete the instructions in these topics, you'll be ready to manage users, manage clusters, and use the included software libraries to perform cryptographic operations\. 

**To get started with AWS CloudHSM**

1. Follow the steps in [Create IAM Administrators](create-iam-user.md) to set up your IAM users and groups\.

1. Follow the steps in [Create a Cluster](create-cluster.md)\.

1. \(First time only\) Follow the steps in [Connect EC2 Instance to Cluster](configure-sg-client-instance.md)\.

1. Follow the steps in [Create an HSM](create-hsm.md)\.

1. \(Optional\) Follow the steps in [Verify HSM Identity \(Optional\)](verify-hsm-identity.md) to verify the identity and authenticity of the cluster's HSM\.

1. Follow the steps in [Initialize the Cluster](initialize-cluster.md)\.

1. \(First time only\) Follow the steps in [Install the Client \(Linux\)](install-and-configure-client-linux.md) if you are using Linux\. Or [Install the Client \(Windows\)](install-and-configure-client-win.md) if you are using Windows\.
