# Getting Started with AWS CloudHSM<a name="getting-started"></a>

The following topics contain information to help you create, initialize, and activate an AWS CloudHSM cluster\. After you complete the instructions in these topics, you'll be ready to manage users, manage clusters, and use the included software libraries to perform cryptographic operations\.
